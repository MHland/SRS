# SRS_python
The Strategic Random Search (SRS) —— A New Global Optimization Algorithm  

There are two files here：
- ***SRS_python.py*** is the main code of the SRS algorithm, which has 10 built-in test functions;
- ***SRS_help.ipynb*** is an example of the use of the srs algorithm, which gives the detailed usage of the SRS code.
- ***xinanjiang_model.py*** is the code of xinanjiang model, it includes the main process of xinanjiang model and calibration of xinanjiang model. Here, we can choose vectorised model to improve time efficiency.
- Other codes are the baseline codes for the Xinanjiang model.
